In this project, I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

I added JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:

1. Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
2. Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields
3. Enhanced the accessiblity for all users by making the focus states and errors obvious to all users:

4. Adding live features such as the total cost of the activites and making the error messages to display immediately once the user types their info.

5. Preventing the user from selecting conflicting activites that are being held on the same day and time
